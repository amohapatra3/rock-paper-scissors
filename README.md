# rock-paper-scissors

A simple rock-paper-scissors game implementation using HTML and JS, played on the console. Game takes input from user via a prompt in a best-of-five series and displays winner of each round and the aggregate winner on the console.

This barebones project helped refresh some basic JS and was just some fun. This could be made more interactive.
